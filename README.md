# Solving Articulation Gap using Generative AI

**Exploring the use cases of Large Language Models (LLMs) in search systems!**

* On e-commerce platforms, when users do not know the exact/catalog correct term for an item, they will use other related terms to describe what they require. 
These search queries are known as â€œArticulation Gap (AG)" queries.
* In a lexial index based retrieval system, AG queries result in low or irrelevant recall. This leads to bad customer experience and has an adverse effect on the business.
* We leverage the power of Large Language Model (**ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo**) to address the above problem.
* Our approach can be broken down into three stages. Each stage uses a separate prompt for its specified task:
  1. <ins>Attribute tagging</ins>: Identifying which token(s) map to which attribute, similar to Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
Example -> input: "0 year clothes winter", output: {"product": "winter clothes", "age":"newborn", "gender":"any"}
  2. <ins>Phrase replacement</ins>: Replacing AG affected attributes with catalog standard vocabulary. 
Example -> newborn is replaced with infant to reformulate the query to "infant winter clothes"
  3. <ins>Query expansion</ins>: Expanding the query by replacing the generic category in the query with specific verticals of that category. 
Example -> infant (onesies OR sleepsuits OR sweaters OR jackets)
* The expanded query is then used for retrieval from the search index, leading to higher and revelant recall.
